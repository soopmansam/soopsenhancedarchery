Before you use this texure pack you need to take the file for your minecraft skin and rename it to skin.png. Put this file in the item folder under textures.     
The file path is [ Soop's Enhanced Archery (standalone) >> assets >> minecraft >> textures >> item >> skin.png ]

This is needed for the first person view to work properly. If you don't do this your arms will appear as Steve's arms instead. 
     
-----------------------------------------
     
(optional)     
I've included a couple of alternative color schemes in this texure pack.     
They can be found under [ Soop's Enhanced Archery (standalone) >> assets >> minecraft >> items >> [name].json ]

if you want every bow to use a color scheme simply rename the one you want to bow.json and rename your original bow.json to something else.

you can also run the following commands to give you a single bow with its corresponding color scheme, although the command may not work if the file you choose has been renamed.     
	/give @p bow[item_model="minecraft:blueyellow"]     
	/give @p bow[item_model="minecraft:grain"]     
	/give @p bow[item_model="minecraft:mesopelagic"]     
	/give @p bow[item_model="minecraft:minimalist"]     
	/give @p bow[item_model="minecraft:piercer"]     
	/give @p bow[item_model="minecraft:scanner"]     
	/give @p bow[item_model="minecraft:ultralight"]
